Python Mini Games Collection

A collection of terminal-based mini games developed in Python.
This repository focuses on fundamental programming concepts, clean structure, and logical problem-solving.

Overview

This project contains small standalone games implemented in Python 3. Each game is designed to reinforce core programming concepts such as:

Control flow

Functions

Input validation

Loops and conditionals

Basic game logic

Random number generation

The repository will continue to expand with additional games over time.
